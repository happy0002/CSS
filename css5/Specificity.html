    <!-- <p>  The Cascade Algorithm
        <ol>
            <li>Position and order of appearance: the order in which your CSS rules appear</li>
            <li>Specificity: an algorithm that determines which CSS selector has the strongest match</li>
            <li>Origin: the order in which CSS appears and where it comes from, whether that is a browser style, CSS from a browser extension, or your authored CSS</li>
            <li>Importance: some CSS rules are weighted more heavily than others, especially with the !important rule type
                Lets look into all these one by one</li>

-> Specificity...
Inline Style > ID Selector > Class or Attribute Selector > Element Selector > Universal Selector

->  Specificity Calculation...
To calculate specificity, assign a value to each part of the selector:

Universal Selector: 0
Element selectors and pseudo-elements: 1
Class selectors, attribute selectors, and pseudo-classes: 10
ID selectors: 100
Inline styles: 1000
Then, add up the values of all the parts in the selector.
